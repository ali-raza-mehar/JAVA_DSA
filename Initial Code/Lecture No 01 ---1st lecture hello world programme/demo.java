public class demo {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello worls");
   }
}

// 1) public--> public mean this class can be access from anywhere
// 2) class --> name group of properties of function 
// 3) main after class --> it is the name of file.if the name of file is ali we will write ali in place of main

// main inside of public class same as it c++ main

// i am object of main class 

// you have to create object of class

// we are running main without creating object of class demo


// void mean no value
